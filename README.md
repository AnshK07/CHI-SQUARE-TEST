 ""Here's a breakdown: 

* Word Counter: The word counter properly counts each word from the input_text, treating punctuation as part of the words (e.g., "text." and "counter." are distinct from "text" and "counter").

* Palindrome Check:  The word "racecar" is a valid palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case and spaces.

# Chi-Square Test:
* Observed Data: Matches the input data for the test.
* Expected Data: Calculated based on the marginal totals of the contingency table.
* Chi-Square Statistic (5.64): Computed from the differences between observed and expected values.
* Degrees of Freedom (4): Calculated as (rows - 1) * (columns - 1).
* P-Value (0.2278): Indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.
* Critical Value (9.49): Derived from the Chi-Square distribution table at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05.
* Decision: Since the Chi-Square statistic (5.64) is less than the critical value (9.49), the null hypothesis is not rejected, indicating no significant association between device type and customer satisfaction.
